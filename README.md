## The Pitch

## Getting Started

## How it Works

## Testing

## Notation

The documentation uses a lot of notation.

- Double underscores in method names usually mean "private".
- Single underscores in the beginning of a method name also means "private".
- In the context of the `O(N)` notation, `N` and `M` are big constants with `M â‰¤ N` if applicable.
- Similarly, `n` and `m` are small constants relative to `N` and `M`.

Code by Artur Roos. Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ktnlvr/subastra). What follows is a list of technologies that are important to this project in no particular order.

- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), the rendering API.
- [cc65 Toolchain](https://cc65.github.io/), a full-on compiler/assembler/linker for the 6502.
- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html), a documentation generation tool.
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), the fanstastic human-readable markup language.
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just), a Make-like quick command runner.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/), the tool more complex scripting.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), the version control system.
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), the best pixel art editor ever.
- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), the best C compiler under the sun.
- [`xxd`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd), the hexdump utility.
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), a faster `grep`.

The following is a looser list of things that were inspirational to the technical aspects of the project.

- [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), a game about building the best factories.
- [Screeps.io](https://screeps.com/), a JavaScript game where you control small agents with code.
